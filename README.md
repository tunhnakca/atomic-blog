# Atomic Blog – React Hooks & Performance (Jonas Schmedtmann)

This project is part of a React course by **Jonas Schmedtmann** and is used to practice **React rendering behavior and performance optimization techniques**.

The focus of the project is understanding how React handles re-renders and how to optimize them using built-in React tools.

---

## React Concepts Practiced

- **Context API**  
  Used for sharing state across components and avoiding prop drilling.

- **React.memo**  
  Used to prevent unnecessary component re-renders when props remain unchanged.

- **useMemo**  
  Used to memoize derived values and avoid expensive recalculations on every render.

- **useCallback**  
  Used to memoize function references to prevent triggering re-renders in memoized child components.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience with **React performance optimization patterns** and to better understand **when and why memoization should be applied**.

This is an educational project focused on React internals rather than production-level features or UI design.
